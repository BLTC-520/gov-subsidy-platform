# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a multi-agent reasoning system using smolagents to perform comprehensive analysis of citizen data. The system takes citizen data as input along with smart queries, leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) documents from a local ChromaDB embedding database, and produces detailed analysis reports with scoring mechanisms for post-processing workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a government analyst, I want to input citizen data and receive comprehensive analysis reports, so that I can make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN citizen data is provided as input THEN the system SHALL accept and validate the data format
2. WHEN a smart query is submitted with citizen data THEN the system SHALL process the query against the citizen data
3. WHEN analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive text-based analysis report
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a numerical score based on the analysis results

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the multi-agent system to leverage local knowledge base, so that analysis is based on relevant policy documents and regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis begins THEN the system SHALL query the local ChromaDB embedding database
2. WHEN relevant documents are found THEN the system SHALL retrieve and incorporate RAG documents into the analysis
3. WHEN no relevant documents are found in ChromaDB THEN the system SHALL use TavilySearch tool to find relevant external information
4. WHEN document retrieval fails THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and continue analysis

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the system to use smolagents for multi-agent reasoning, so that complex citizen data can be analyzed from multiple perspectives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is initiated THEN the system SHALL deploy multiple smolagents for reasoning
2. WHEN agents are processing THEN each agent SHALL focus on different aspects of the citizen data
3. WHEN agents complete their analysis THEN the system SHALL aggregate results from all agents
4. WHEN agent coordination is needed THEN the system SHALL facilitate communication between agents

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an end user, I want to receive analysis results in a structured format, so that I can easily understand and process the findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a text file containing the comprehensive analysis
2. WHEN the analysis file is created THEN it SHALL include structured sections for different analysis aspects
3. WHEN scoring is calculated THEN the system SHALL include the numerical score in the output
4. WHEN post-processing is required THEN the output format SHALL be compatible with downstream systems

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the analysis system to handle errors gracefully, so that partial failures don't prevent useful analysis from being completed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid citizen data is provided THEN the system SHALL return clear validation error messages
2. WHEN ChromaDB is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue analysis with available data and log the limitation
3. WHEN an agent fails THEN the system SHALL continue with remaining agents and note the failure in the output
4. WHEN system resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them when resources are available

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want the system to maintain audit trails, so that analysis decisions can be reviewed and verified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis begins THEN the system SHALL log the input data characteristics (without storing sensitive data)
2. WHEN agents make decisions THEN the system SHALL log the reasoning process
3. WHEN documents are retrieved THEN the system SHALL log which documents were used
4. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL create an audit log entry with timestamp and processing details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to review and approve agent plans before execution, so that I can ensure the analysis approach is appropriate and modify it if needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent creates a PlanningStep THEN the system SHALL interrupt execution using step callbacks
2. WHEN a plan is displayed THEN the user SHALL see formatted plan content with clear options to approve, modify, or cancel
3. WHEN a user chooses to modify a plan THEN the system SHALL provide a text editor interface for plan modification
4. WHEN a plan is approved or modified THEN the system SHALL resume execution with reset=False to preserve agent memory
5. WHEN a plan is cancelled THEN the system SHALL call agent.interrupt() and terminate analysis gracefully
6. WHEN plan modification occurs THEN the system SHALL update the memory_step.plan attribute directly
7. WHEN resuming after interruption THEN the system SHALL maintain all previous agent memory and context

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to configure human-in-the-loop settings, so that I can control when user intervention is required during analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN operators SHALL be able to set step_callbacks for PlanningStep interruption
2. WHEN plan review is enabled THEN the system SHALL use interrupt_after_plan callback function
3. WHEN plan review is disabled THEN the system SHALL initialize agents without step_callbacks
4. WHEN timeout settings are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically proceed after specified timeout
5. WHEN multiple planning intervals occur THEN the system SHALL interrupt at each planning_interval step
6. WHEN agent memory needs preservation THEN the system SHALL use reset=False parameter for continued execution

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to use smolagents framework with proper tool integration, so that the multi-agent analysis leverages the full capability of the framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing agents THEN the system SHALL use CodeAgent with LiteLLMModel (gpt-4o-mini)
2. WHEN configuring tools THEN the system SHALL include DuckDuckGoSearchTool, RetrieverTool, and custom analysis tools
3. WHEN setting planning behavior THEN the system SHALL configure planning_interval for regular plan creation
4. WHEN handling interruptions THEN the system SHALL properly implement step callback functions
5. WHEN resuming execution THEN the system SHALL call agent.run() with reset=False to maintain memory state
6. WHEN managing agent memory THEN the system SHALL access and modify agent.memory.steps as needed

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend service to have all necessary dependencies and integrations, so that the smolagents-based analysis can function with RAG capabilities and external search.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the service THEN the system SHALL install smolagents with toolkit and litellm extensions
2. WHEN configuring document processing THEN the system SHALL include markdownify, unstructured-client, and unstructured[all-docs]
3. WHEN setting up search capabilities THEN the system SHALL include duckduckgo-search and tavily-search tools
4. WHEN configuring RAG functionality THEN the system SHALL include chromadb, faiss-cpu, sentence-transformers, and rank_bm25
5. WHEN integrating with databases THEN the system SHALL include pymongo for MongoDB connectivity
6. WHEN setting up vector databases THEN the system SHALL include supabase client for document storage integration
7. WHEN configuring LLM providers THEN the system SHALL include openai, litellm, and transformers libraries
8. WHEN setting up data processing THEN the system SHALL include pandas and datasets for data manipulation
