# Dual-Analysis Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan restructures the smolagents-service to implement a **dual-analysis + comparison** architecture that demonstrates the trade-offs between interpretability (formula-based) and flexibility (RAG-based) approaches in AI governance systems.

**Research Objective**: *"Multi-Agent RAG for Auditable Token Distribution"* - showcasing when AI flexibility is beneficial versus when mathematical transparency is required for public accountability.

**Core Architecture**: 
- **RAG Analysis Path**: Multi-agent reasoning using existing tools (Tasks 2.1-2.4)
- **Formula Analysis Path**: Transparent burden-score calculation (Task 2.3)
- **Comparison Module**: Agreement/disagreement analysis for governance insights

## Phase 1: Dual Analysis Core (Backend)

### 1. Foundation Components (Already Complete ✅)

**These existing components form the foundation of the dual-analysis architecture:**

- **[x] 1.1 CitizenAnalysisAgent (Task 2.1)** - Repurposed as RAG analysis path
  - ✅ Smolagents-based agent with LiteLLMModel integration
  - ✅ Tool initialization and basic reasoning capabilities
  - ✅ Will be simplified (no plan review) for dual-analysis use
  - **Role in Dual Analysis**: Handles flexible, context-aware policy reasoning

- **[x] 1.2 CitizenDataValidationTool (Task 2.2)** - Used by both analysis paths
  - ✅ Input validation with comprehensive error handling
  - ✅ Format checking and basic eligibility screening
  - **Role in Dual Analysis**: Common validation layer before analysis

- **[x] 1.3 EligibilityScoreTool (Task 2.3)** - Core of formula analysis path
  - ✅ Burden-based scoring with equivalised income methodology
  - ✅ CSV lookup for state-specific income equivalents
  - ✅ Transparent, auditable mathematical calculations
  - **Role in Dual Analysis**: Provides interpretable, deterministic scoring

- **[x] 1.4 ChromaDBRetrieverTool (Task 2.4)** - Used by RAG analysis path
  - ✅ Semantic search in policy document corpus
  - ✅ MongoDB integration for document chunks
  - ✅ Fallback strategies for retrieval failures
  - **Role in Dual Analysis**: Enables contextual policy reasoning

### 2. New Dual-Analysis Components

  - **Output Format**:
    ```json
    {
      "score": 78.5,
      "burden_score": 78.5,
      "eligibility_class": "B40", 
      "explanation": "Burden score 78.5 calculated using equivalised income (RM4734.0) with adult equivalent scale (2.1 for 4-person household). Components: Burden 65pts (55%), Documentation 25pts (25%), Disability 0pts (20%).",

  - Implement score difference calculation and classification mismatch detection
  - Add low confidence detection (RAG confidence < 0.5 → favor formula)
  - Generate governance recommendations:
    - Agreement: "Both methods agree" → high confidence
    - Disagreement: Explain trade-offs and recommend decision approach
    - RAG failure: "Formula-only result" with transparency note
  - **Comparison Output**:
    ```json
    {
      "agreement": false,
      "score_difference": 12.3,
      "class_mismatch": true,
      "recommendation": "Formula: B40, RAG: M40-M1 (favor formula for transparency)",

  - Implement graceful degradation strategies:
    - RAG failure → Continue with formula-only + explanatory comment
    - Formula failure (rare) → RAG-only with caution warning
    - Both fail → HTTP 500 with clear error message

## Future Work (Moved from Original Plan)

The following advanced features have been moved to future development to focus on core dual-analysis research objectives:

### Advanced Multi-Agent Features (Original Phase 3-5)
- Plan review infrastructure with human-in-the-loop workflows
- WebSocket real-time updates and agent visualization
- Multi-agent orchestration with manager agents
- Memory preservation during interruptions

### Enhanced Search and Analysis (Original Phase 5-6)
- Hybrid BM25 + semantic search implementation
- Smart query generation with citizen context optimization
- Advanced policy analysis tools with conflict detection
- DuckDuckGo integration for external policy search

### Production Features (Original Phase 7-11)
- Comprehensive caching strategies and performance optimization
- Advanced monitoring, observability, and alerting systems
- Security enhancements and data protection measures
- Scalability features and resource management

**Rationale**: These features represent significant development overhead that would detract from the core research demonstration. The simplified dual-analysis approach provides clear research value while remaining implementable within FYP timelines.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Environment
- Always run `source venv/bin/activate` before testing or implementing
- Refer to updated design.md for architectural guidance
- Run existing tests to ensure no regression in completed components (Tasks 2.1-2.4)

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Focus on new dual-analysis components (2.1-2.4)
2. **Phase 2**: Single endpoint implementation (3.1-3.3)
3. **Phase 3**: Frontend tabbed interface (4.1-4.4)
4. **Phase 4**: Research validation and documentation (5.1-6.2)

### Success Criteria
- Working `/analyze-citizen` endpoint returning dual analysis + comparison
- Functional tabbed frontend demonstrating interpretability vs flexibility trade-offs
- Comparative analysis results showing agreement rates and disagreement patterns
- Clean, presentation-ready system suitable for FYP demonstration

### Research Focus
This implementation plan prioritizes the core research contribution: demonstrating how AI governance systems can balance **transparency** (formula-based) with **contextual reasoning** (RAG-based) through systematic comparison and analysis.
