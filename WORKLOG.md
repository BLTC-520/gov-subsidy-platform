## July 05 (12:00pm - 1:00pm) - Profile Split & File Security ⚡

#### Files Created:
- `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` - Read-only profile view

#### Files Enhanced:
- `src/pages/CitizenProfilePage.tsx` - Form-only (removed tabs)
- `src/components/common/CitizenLayout.tsx` - Added "Application Form" + "Profile" menu
- `src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts` - SHA-256 duplicate detection + filename sanitization
- `src/components/admin/DocumentList.tsx` - Batch delete with checkboxes

#### What We Built:
1. **Profile Separation**: Form editing vs viewing as separate pages
2. **Content Duplicate Detection**: SHA-256 hashing prevents same file uploads
3. **Filename Sanitization**: Handles special characters, length limits, security
4. **Batch File Operations**: Select multiple files, bulk delete
5. **Advanced Validation**: Control characters, dangerous patterns, MIME types

#### SHA-256 Code & Analysis:
```javascript
const calculateFileHash = async (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = async (event) => {
    const arrayBuffer = event.target?.result as ArrayBuffer; // Loads ENTIRE file into RAM
    const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', arrayBuffer);
    const hashHex = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer))
      .map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
    resolve(hashHex);
  };
  reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file); // ⚠️ Memory bomb for large files
};
```
**>1GB File Problem:** Browser crashes! `readAsArrayBuffer()` loads entire file into memory
**Result:** 1GB file = 1GB RAM usage → Browser freeze/crash, especially mobile devices
**Solution:** Chunked reading with streams or file size limits (we limit to PDF/DOCX ~50MB max)

#### Problem Solved:
- Same file uploaded twice with different timestamps → Now blocked by content hash
- Filename security issues → Sanitized and validated  
- No bulk operations → Added batch delete with UI selection

- Income classification logic: 10 precise Malaysian brackets with threshold comparisons  
- Signature verification: HMAC-SHA256 validation within circuit constraints
- Anti-replay protection: Timestamp age validation (max 24 hours = 86400 seconds)
- Output: Classification flags + signature validity + data authenticity

**2. Backend ZK Service (`zk-circuit-service.js`):**
- **Automated trusted setup**: Downloads Powers of Tau, generates proving/verification keys
- **Real timestamp validation**: `ageInSeconds = Math.floor((now - verificationTime) / 1000)`
- **Witness generation**: Converts API responses to field elements compatible with circuit
- **Proof generation**: Complete Groth16 proof creation with π_a, π_b, π_c components
- **Dual API endpoints**: `/lookup-citizen` (fast name lookup) + `/verify-income` (full ZK verification)

**3. Mock LHDN API (`mock-lhdn-api`):**
- **HMAC-SHA256 signatures**: Signs income data with government authority simulation
- **Test citizen database**: 2 citizens with different income brackets for comprehensive testing
