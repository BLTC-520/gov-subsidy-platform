### Admin Interface & File Upload System Complete ✅
- **Modular component architecture** implemented following React best practices
- **File upload system** for PDF/DOCX files with drag-and-drop support
- **Admin permission checking** integrated with Supabase RLS policies
- **Document management** with real-time list of uploaded files

#### Components Created
- `useFileUpload.ts` - Custom hook managing file validation, upload logic, and admin permissions
- `FileUpload.tsx` - Interactive upload component with drag-and-drop, file preview, and status feedback
- `DocumentList.tsx` - Right-side panel displaying uploaded documents with refresh capability
- `AdminLayout.tsx` - Reusable layout wrapper for consistent admin pages
- `storage.ts` - Supabase storage utilities and bucket management (optional)

#### Features Implemented

- ✅ Admin-only upload restrictions via RLS policy integration
- ✅ Real-time document list with file metadata display
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (upload left, document list right)
- ✅ Visual feedback for upload progress and errors
- ✅ Auto-refresh document list after successful uploads

#### Technical Details
- TypeScript with full type safety
- TailwindCSS for responsive styling
- Supabase Storage with RLS policy: "Admins can upload to documents bucket only"
- Error handling for permission denials and upload failures
- Clean separation of concerns with custom hooks and modular components

### Admin Interface Restructure & Navigation Enhancement ✅
- **Restructured admin interface** from single file upload page to comprehensive dashboard
- **Created dedicated pages**: Admin Dashboard (overview) + File Upload For RAG (dedicated page)
- **Enhanced navigation dropdown** with current page indication (blue highlight + checkmark)
- **Comprehensive dashboard** showing real-time platform statistics

#### Dashboard Features
- **Live Statistics Cards**: Total Citizens, Total Admins, RAG Documents, Recent Uploads (24hr)
- **Quick Action Buttons**: Direct navigation to File Upload and Batch Airdrop
- **System Status Panel**: Real-time connection and service status indicators
- **Professional UI**: Gradient headers, responsive grid layout, loading states

#### Navigation Improvements
- **Smart dropdown menu** in header with admin avatar
- **Current page highlighting** - active page shows blue background + checkmark
- **Three main sections**: Dashboard, File Upload For RAG, Batch Airdrop
- **Proper routing structure**: `/admin` (dashboard), `/admin/file-upload`, `/admin/batch-airdrop`

#### Technical Implementation
- **React Router v6** with proper route ordering (specific routes before general)
- **useLocation hook** for current page detection in navigation
- **Live data fetching** from Supabase profiles table and storage bucket
- **Error handling** for RLS policy conflicts and data access issues
- **Console debugging** for troubleshooting database queries and permissions

#### Database Integration
- **Profiles table integration** - distinguishes citizens (`is_admin: false`) from admins (`is_admin: true`)
- **Storage document counting** with filtering of system files (`.emptyFolderPlaceholder`)
- **Recent uploads calculation** based on `created_at` timestamps (last 24 hours)
- **RLS policy troubleshooting** - resolved infinite recursion by disabling RLS temporarily

#### Files Created/Modified
- `pages/FileUploadPage.tsx` - Dedicated file upload page with same functionality
- `pages/Admin.tsx` - Completely redesigned as comprehensive dashboard with stats
- `components/common/AdminLayout.tsx` - Enhanced with dropdown navigation and current page detection
