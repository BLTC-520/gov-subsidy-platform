## July 03 (8:30pm - 10:30pm) - 2 Hours Sprint ⚡
### Phase 3: Complete Citizen Portal & Deadline Management ✅ COMPLETE

#### 🚀 Major Achievements (2 Hour Sprint):
- **✅ Fixed Authentication Issues**: Resolved infinite recursion in RLS policies
- **✅ Complete Citizen Portal**: Full profile form with Malaysian states & Ethereum validation  
- **✅ Admin-Controlled Deadlines**: Dynamic deadline system with real-time countdown
- **✅ Real-time Form Disabling**: Form auto-disables when deadline passes (no refresh needed)
- **✅ Comprehensive Edge Case Testing**: All validation scenarios tested and working

#### 🔧 Critical Technical Fixes:
1. **RLS Infinite Recursion Solved**: 
   - Created `is_user_admin()` security definer function
   - Fixed "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'profiles'" error
   - Proper admin access to view all profiles for dashboard stats

2. **Role-Based Authentication**: 
   - Direct role checking during login (`is_admin` field validation)
   - Simplified routing: admin → `/admin`, citizen → `/citizen`
   - Handles both boolean `true` and string `"true"` values for is_admin

3. **Real-time Deadline Management**:
   - Admin sets deadline in Application Settings panel
   - Citizens see countdown timer with visual urgency (green → yellow → red)
   - Form automatically disables when deadline passes (10-second interval checking)

#### 🎯 New Features Implemented:

**Admin Dashboard Enhancements:**
- Application Settings panel for deadline management
- DateTime picker for setting submission deadlines
- Real-time countdown display for admins
- Fixed statistics showing correct counts (Citizens: 1, Admins: 1, Documents: 1)

**Complete Citizen Portal:**
- Profile form with Malaysian states dropdown (16 states + territories)
- Ethereum wallet address validation (`/^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/`)
- Real-time deadline countdown with visual urgency indicators
- Form validation: negative values, required fields, boundary conditions
- Auto-save prevention when deadline passes

**Deadline System:**
- `app_settings` table for dynamic configuration
- Real-time countdown timer component
- Form disable logic with immediate effect (no refresh required)
- Visual deadline status in citizen portal

#### 🧪 Edge Cases Tested & Working:
- ✅ **Invalid Ethereum Address**: `0x123` (too short) shows validation error
- ✅ **Negative Values**: `-5` children, `0` household size, `-1000` income blocked
- ✅ **Real-time Deadline**: Set 2-minute deadline, form disables when countdown hits zero
- ✅ **Extreme Values**: Boundary condition testing passed
- ✅ **Concurrent Access**: Admin/citizen in different tabs working correctly

#### Files Created/Modified:
**New Hooks:**
- `src/hooks/useAppSettings.ts` - Deadline management with real-time updates
- `src/hooks/useProfile.ts` - Citizen profile CRUD operations with validation

## July 05 (12:00pm - 1:00pm) - Profile Split & File Security ⚡

#### Files Created:
- `src/pages/ProfilePage.tsx` - Read-only profile view

#### Files Enhanced:
- `src/pages/CitizenProfilePage.tsx` - Form-only (removed tabs)
- `src/components/common/CitizenLayout.tsx` - Added "Application Form" + "Profile" menu
- `src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts` - SHA-256 duplicate detection + filename sanitization
- `src/components/admin/DocumentList.tsx` - Batch delete with checkboxes

#### What We Built:
1. **Profile Separation**: Form editing vs viewing as separate pages
2. **Content Duplicate Detection**: SHA-256 hashing prevents same file uploads
3. **Filename Sanitization**: Handles special characters, length limits, security
4. **Batch File Operations**: Select multiple files, bulk delete
5. **Advanced Validation**: Control characters, dangerous patterns, MIME types

#### SHA-256 Code & Analysis:
```javascript
const calculateFileHash = async (file: File): Promise<string> => {
  const reader = new FileReader();
  reader.onload = async (event) => {
    const arrayBuffer = event.target?.result as ArrayBuffer; // Loads ENTIRE file into RAM
    const hashBuffer = await crypto.subtle.digest('SHA-256', arrayBuffer);
    const hashHex = Array.from(new Uint8Array(hashBuffer))
      .map(b => b.toString(16).padStart(2, '0')).join('');
    resolve(hashHex);
  };
  reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file); // ⚠️ Memory bomb for large files
};
```
**>1GB File Problem:** Browser crashes! `readAsArrayBuffer()` loads entire file into memory
**Result:** 1GB file = 1GB RAM usage → Browser freeze/crash, especially mobile devices
**Solution:** Chunked reading with streams or file size limits (we limit to PDF/DOCX ~50MB max)

#### Problem Solved:
- Same file uploaded twice with different timestamps → Now blocked by content hash
- Filename security issues → Sanitized and validated  
- No bulk operations → Added batch delete with UI selection
