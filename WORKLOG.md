### Admin Interface & File Upload System Complete âœ…
- **Modular component architecture** implemented following React best practices
- **File upload system** for PDF/DOCX files with drag-and-drop support
- **Admin permission checking** integrated with Supabase RLS policies
- **Document management** with real-time list of uploaded files

#### Components Created
- `useFileUpload.ts` - Custom hook managing file validation, upload logic, and admin permissions
- `FileUpload.tsx` - Interactive upload component with drag-and-drop, file preview, and status feedback
- `DocumentList.tsx` - Right-side panel displaying uploaded documents with refresh capability
- `AdminLayout.tsx` - Reusable layout wrapper for consistent admin pages
- `storage.ts` - Supabase storage utilities and bucket management (optional)

#### Features Implemented
- âœ… Multiple file upload with PDF/DOCX validation
- âœ… Admin-only upload restrictions via RLS policy integration
- âœ… Real-time document list with file metadata display
- âœ… Responsive grid layout (upload left, document list right)
- âœ… Visual feedback for upload progress and errors
- âœ… Auto-refresh document list after successful uploads

#### Technical Details
- TypeScript with full type safety
- TailwindCSS for responsive styling
- Supabase Storage with RLS policy: "Admins can upload to documents bucket only"
- Error handling for permission denials and upload failures
- Clean separation of concerns with custom hooks and modular components

### Admin Interface Restructure & Navigation Enhancement âœ…
- **Restructured admin interface** from single file upload page to comprehensive dashboard
- **Created dedicated pages**: Admin Dashboard (overview) + File Upload For RAG (dedicated page)
- **Enhanced navigation dropdown** with current page indication (blue highlight + checkmark)
- **Comprehensive dashboard** showing real-time platform statistics

#### Dashboard Features
- **Live Statistics Cards**: Total Citizens, Total Admins, RAG Documents, Recent Uploads (24hr)
- **Quick Action Buttons**: Direct navigation to File Upload and Batch Airdrop
- **System Status Panel**: Real-time connection and service status indicators
- **Professional UI**: Gradient headers, responsive grid layout, loading states

#### Navigation Improvements
- **Smart dropdown menu** in header with admin avatar
- **Current page highlighting** - active page shows blue background + checkmark
- **Three main sections**: Dashboard, File Upload For RAG, Batch Airdrop
- **Proper routing structure**: `/admin` (dashboard), `/admin/file-upload`, `/admin/batch-airdrop`

#### Technical Implementation
- **React Router v6** with proper route ordering (specific routes before general)
- **useLocation hook** for current page detection in navigation
- **Live data fetching** from Supabase profiles table and storage bucket
- **Error handling** for RLS policy conflicts and data access issues
- **Console debugging** for troubleshooting database queries and permissions

#### Database Integration
- **Profiles table integration** - distinguishes citizens (`is_admin: false`) from admins (`is_admin: true`)
- **Storage document counting** with filtering of system files (`.emptyFolderPlaceholder`)
- **Recent uploads calculation** based on `created_at` timestamps (last 24 hours)
- **RLS policy troubleshooting** - resolved infinite recursion by disabling RLS temporarily

#### Files Created/Modified
- `pages/FileUploadPage.tsx` - Dedicated file upload page with same functionality
- `pages/Admin.tsx` - Completely redesigned as comprehensive dashboard with stats
- `components/common/AdminLayout.tsx` - Enhanced with dropdown navigation and current page detection
- `App.tsx` - Updated routing with proper route ordering for nested paths

## July 03 (8:30pm - 10:30pm) - 2 Hours Sprint âš¡
### Phase 3: Complete Citizen Portal & Deadline Management âœ… COMPLETE

#### ðŸš€ Major Achievements (2 Hour Sprint):
- **âœ… Fixed Authentication Issues**: Resolved infinite recursion in RLS policies
- **âœ… Complete Citizen Portal**: Full profile form with Malaysian states & Ethereum validation  
- **âœ… Admin-Controlled Deadlines**: Dynamic deadline system with real-time countdown
- **âœ… Real-time Form Disabling**: Form auto-disables when deadline passes (no refresh needed)
- **âœ… Comprehensive Edge Case Testing**: All validation scenarios tested and working

#### ðŸ”§ Critical Technical Fixes:
1. **RLS Infinite Recursion Solved**: 
   - Created `is_user_admin()` security definer function
   - Fixed "infinite recursion detected in policy for relation 'profiles'" error
   - Proper admin access to view all profiles for dashboard stats

2. **Role-Based Authentication**: 
   - Direct role checking during login (`is_admin` field validation)
   - Simplified routing: admin â†’ `/admin`, citizen â†’ `/citizen`
   - Handles both boolean `true` and string `"true"` values for is_admin

3. **Real-time Deadline Management**:
   - Admin sets deadline in Application Settings panel
   - Citizens see countdown timer with visual urgency (green â†’ yellow â†’ red)
   - Form automatically disables when deadline passes (10-second interval checking)

#### ðŸŽ¯ New Features Implemented:

**Admin Dashboard Enhancements:**
- Application Settings panel for deadline management
- DateTime picker for setting submission deadlines
- Real-time countdown display for admins
- Fixed statistics showing correct counts (Citizens: 1, Admins: 1, Documents: 1)

**Complete Citizen Portal:**
- Profile form with Malaysian states dropdown (16 states + territories)
- Ethereum wallet address validation (`/^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$/`)
- Real-time deadline countdown with visual urgency indicators
- Form validation: negative values, required fields, boundary conditions
- Auto-save prevention when deadline passes

**Deadline System:**
- `app_settings` table for dynamic configuration
- Real-time countdown timer component
- Form disable logic with immediate effect (no refresh required)
- Visual deadline status in citizen portal

#### ðŸ§ª Edge Cases Tested & Working:
- âœ… **Invalid Ethereum Address**: `0x123` (too short) shows validation error
- âœ… **Negative Values**: `-5` children, `0` household size, `-1000` income blocked
- âœ… **Real-time Deadline**: Set 2-minute deadline, form disables when countdown hits zero
- âœ… **Extreme Values**: Boundary condition testing passed
- âœ… **Concurrent Access**: Admin/citizen in different tabs working correctly

#### Files Created/Modified:
**New Hooks:**
- `src/hooks/useAppSettings.ts` - Deadline management with real-time updates
- `src/hooks/useProfile.ts` - Citizen profile CRUD operations with validation
- `src/hooks/useDeadlineStatus.ts` - Real-time deadline checking (10-second intervals)

**New Components:**
- `src/components/admin/ApplicationSettings.tsx` - Admin deadline control panel
- `src/components/common/CitizenLayout.tsx` - Citizen portal layout with navigation
- `src/components/common/CountdownTimer.tsx` - Real-time countdown with urgency colors

**New Pages:**
- `src/pages/CitizenProfilePage.tsx` - Complete citizen profile form
- `src/pages/CitizenClaimPage.tsx` - Future claim functionality placeholder

**Enhanced:**
- `src/pages/Login.tsx` - Fixed role checking (boolean/string handling)
- `src/pages/Admin.tsx` - Added Application Settings panel, fixed stats queries
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated routing for citizen pages

#### Malaysian States Implemented:
`['Johor', 'Kedah', 'Kelantan', 'Melaka', 'Negeri Sembilan', 'Pahang', 'Pulau Pinang', 'Perak', 'Perlis', 'Sabah', 'Sarawak', 'Selangor', 'Terengganu', 'Kuala Lumpur', 'Labuan', 'Putrajaya']`

#### âš¡ Performance Notes:
- Real-time deadline checking: 10-second intervals (balance between UX and performance)
- Countdown timer: 1-minute intervals for display updates
- Form disable: Immediate effect without page refresh
- Total build time: ~500ms (optimized bundle)

#### ðŸŽ‰ Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL CITIZEN PORTAL
- Citizens can register, fill profiles, see countdown, submit before deadline
- Admins can manage deadlines, view statistics, upload documents
- Real-time feedback and validation throughout the user journey
- Ready for Phase 4: AI Integration for eligibility scoring
